# Ansible_project

Description:
Excited to share my hands-on experience with Ansible in a real-time automation project! üöÄ

Highlights of the Project:
1Ô∏è.Provisioning EC2 Instances with Ansible Loops

Automated the creation of three AWS EC2 instances:
Two running Ubuntu
One running CentOS
Leveraged connection: local for executing tasks from the Ansible control node.
2Ô∏è.Passwordless Authentication Setup

Established keyless SSH authentication between the Ansible control node and all EC2 instances to enable seamless automation.
3Ô∏è.Conditional Automation for Instance Shutdown

Automated the shutdown of Ubuntu instances only using Ansible conditionals (when clause).
Gathered system facts dynamically to execute targeted actions.
Through this project, I gained deeper insights into:

Writing efficient Ansible playbooks with loops and conditionals.
Managing multi-distro environments.
Automating real-world infrastructure tasks with ease.
